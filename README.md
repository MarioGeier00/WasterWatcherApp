### Description
The WasteWatcherApp is preferably a mobile application which allows the user to track the consumed waste.
The camera of the smartphone is being used to scan the Barcode and therefore identify the product.
Furthermore the product id will be used to retrieve information regarding the amount of plastic/paper/metal/... waste
which can then be mapped to the corresponding CO2 emission.
